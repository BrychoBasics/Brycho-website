Open image with photoshop.

Add an adjustment curve, set input and output both to 75 (just cuts down on the really bright spots, for the particular gray paper textures only)

Image > Image size > choose max (for textures needed extra leeway for movement within the image)

choose bicubic sharper (reduction)

(this preserves the most detail, but need to be cautious about the white hotspots, hence the adjustment curve)


File > Save a copy > webp format

70% quality... ends up pretty blurry, but nice file size. 

80% quality... really nice, but start to get bad file size

75% quality (default for "High")... nice sweet spot!




UNDO IMAGE SIZE ADJUSTMENT BEFORE APPLYING A NEW ONE... multiple resizes greatly affects quality



IF I WERE TO DO IT ALL AGAIN: Maybe lower the curve even more. 
It sounds drastic but once it's on screen, those brights are really visible!
